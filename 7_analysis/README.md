Script for the analysis of the Rhesus macaque mutation rate:

  age.r - To analyze the effect of the parental age on the mutation rate and the parental contribution

  CpG.r - to get the number of base in CPG sites

  type_mutation.r - To analyze the mutational spectrum, CpG location and the allelic balance of de novo candidates

  distance.r - the random simulation of mutations, the distance between mutations and shared between siblings

  phylogeny.r - Phylogenetic analysis with Ne estimation, dating and comparison with the literature
